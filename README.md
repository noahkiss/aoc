# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code (2023). The Advent of Code is an annual series of coding challenges that run each day from December 1st through December 25th.

## Language and Tools

For 2023, I am tackling the challenges using JavaScript. This choice is based on the language's versatility and the availability of a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.

## Structure and Methodology

- Each day's challenge is organized in its separate directory, named `Day01`, `Day02`, ..., `Day25`.
- Inside each directory, there are two main files:
  - `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for solving the day's puzzles.
  - `input.txt`: Holds the input data for the day's challenges.
- The solutions are structured to allow for easy reading and understanding, with a focus on clean, efficient code.
- Common or shared logic and functions are utilized across different days to maintain code efficiency and readability.

## Branching Structure

- Each year's Advent of Code solutions are maintained on a separate branch, e.g., `2023` for the year 2023.
- This branching strategy helps in organizing the solutions year-wise and makes it easy to navigate through different years' challenges.

## Future Years and Adaptability

This README template and the overall structure of the repository, including the branching strategy, are designed to be easily adaptable for future Advent of Code events and different programming languages.
