# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code (2022). The Advent of Code is an annual series of coding challenges that run each day from December 1st through December 25th.

## Language and Tools

For 2022, I am tackling the challenges using Python. This choice is driven by Python's simplicity, readability, and the extensive support of libraries that make it an ideal language for such problem-solving scenarios.

## Structure and Methodology

- Each day's challenge is organized in its separate directory, named `Day01`, `Day02`, ..., `Day25`.
- Inside each directory, there are two main files:
  - `main.py`: Contains the Python code for solving the day's puzzles.
  - `input.txt`: Holds the input data for the day's challenges.
- The solutions are structured to allow for easy reading and understanding, with a focus on clean, efficient code.
- Shared functions and common approaches are utilized across different days to enhance code reuse and maintainability.

## Branching Structure

- Each year's Advent of Code solutions are maintained on a separate branch, e.g., `2022` for the year 2022.
- This branching strategy helps in organizing the solutions year-wise and makes it easy to navigate through different years' challenges.

## Future Years and Adaptability

This README template and the overall structure of the repository, including the branching strategy, are designed to be easily adaptable for future Advent of Code events and different programming languages.
